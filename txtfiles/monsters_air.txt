Physical monsters are easier for a Fighter to fight.
Magical monsters are easier for Mages.

At higher levels, magical monsters will always hit Fighters,
and physical monsters will always lay the smack down on mages.

NOTE 1: Can sometimes do a LOT of damage.
NOTE 2: Suffocate?
NOTE 3: Summoned by aeroslay
NOTE 4: Special high damage attack/befuddle
NOTE 5: Summon djinnis/rocs and befuddle

TODO - Guile, can Banshee special attack rules can be revealed?

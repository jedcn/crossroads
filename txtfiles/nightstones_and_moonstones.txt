Nightstones and Moonstones

Nightstones and Moonstones may be used to return you to a safe
place in the event of trouble.

However, Nightstones are only usable at lower levels.
Eventually they become less effective and you will have to
switch to using Moonstones.

Best to have/use 2 nightstones a the first one may pop!

Also know that Moonstones may not get you out of every place!

Levels  Notes
1-5     Use Nightstones
6-7     Nightstones may pop! Carry extras, or start using Moonstones.
8-30    Use Moonstones only.

Rehtiks/Ralek Suggests:
While we're waiting for maps of areas to be created I was wondering if
anyone cared to post suggested levels for different areas.  The people
I've talked to on the game seem more than happy to share their advice
so I figured it would be safe to ask.  My knowledge from long ago is
very limited and I only remember very high level areas well.

Camron Uhr Responds with a breakdown by element:
Air:
5-8   Swamp - Nixies, Crocs, etc.
8-10  Reef - Sea lions, sea otters, sea turtles, seals, lionfish, jellyfish, octopus
10-11 Reef - Sea lions, etc. + rays, eels
12-15 Reef - Everything (be careful with reef sharks, be at full HP when you attack)
15-17 Ocean - Dolphins, sisters, nymphs, tanglers, mermaids
17-18 Ocean - All above + Mermen
18-21 Ocean - Mermaids/men Tanglers, Nymphs, sisters, dolphins, and seahorses (be careful on the seahorses)
21-23 Ocean - Add in Tritons
23-24 Ocean - Add in Killer Whales
24-26 Ocean - Add in Tiger Sharks, can begin going deeper into Acheron, call for help vs. Hydras
27    You can begin toying with Efreetis - a very easy way to rocket to 30 if you are careful.
27-30 All of Ocean, All of Acheron, All of underground area of Earth (have stoneshield).

Earth:
5-8   Desert/Swamp
8-10  Reef - Sea lions seals, sea otters, sea turtles, octopus, jellyfish, lionfish
10-12 Reef - Add in Eels
12-15 All in reef (be careful of rays and reef sharks)
15-17 Ocean - Mermaids, tanglers, dolphins, sisters, nymphs, Fire - Magmen and Nightmares
17-19 Ocean - Add in mermen, can explore acheron for succubus and incubus if you have a
      character to help you out should you get stuck
19-21 Ocean - Add in Seahorses.
20    You can fight Sphinxs in Earth
21-23 Tritons, Sphinx, Seahorses, Mermen, and magmen
23    Add in Killer Whales
24    Add in tigersharks, can do underground earth realm
25-27 All of Ocean and underground earth realm
27-30 Marids.  VERY easy to get to lvl 30.  Just watch HP and leave before potions are gone from inventory

Water (Good luck! Spell casters do earth, fighters do equivalent in air)
5-8   Earth - Rams/Cougars/Rats
8-10  Earth - Bears/Orcs
10-12 Earth - Graveyard
12-15 Earth - Graveyard and Mine shaft
15-17 Earth - Cobras, Centaurs, mine shaft
17-23 Earth - Centaurs and Sphinx
23-26 Earth - Sphinx, Centaurs, begin doing some of underground earth
      (Gorgons/golems/earthworms/Gold dragon) - becareful though, water has low speed, and gets double hit often
26-30 Earth - Gotik, Gold Dragon, other underground areas.  Some Acheron (be careful) Not sure (haven't tested yet), but should be able to whack on the efreeti at lvl 28 or 29 to gain expFire: Fight in Earth and air, same as water.  Except spellcasters fight in Air and fighters fight in earth (better chance of actually defending against some attacks)

Hope that helps!  Typical time from 1-30 following this system is approx. 18-24 hours of playing time.
Make sure to caveat that the earth/air suggestions are for people who choose each elements specialty
(i.e. an earth mage will not do well with the suggestions for earth :)

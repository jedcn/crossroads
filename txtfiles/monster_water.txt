Physical monsters are easier for a Fighter to fight.
Magical monsters are easier for Mages.

At higher levels, magical monsters will always hit Fighters,
and physical monsters will always lay the smack down on mages.

NOTE 2:
"As I learned just now, attacking a sperm whale is a bad idea.
 Exile,would you mind updating the info on your site?
 I hit a sperm whalefor 88, and it swallowed me whole.
 Sperm whales swallow you where you get stuck unless they are
 killed in one hit. I was advised that ittakes about 200 hps to kill it."
